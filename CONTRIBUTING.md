This is my first open source full-scale project, and I want to keep control of the features and code style.
However, I do realize that doing this alone might be too ambitious, so I found this middle pathway:

 - Fixed a bug? Great! Please send a pull request so I can take a look at it
 - Found a bug? Please create an issue
 - Have a feature request/want to change something? Please create an issue, let's talk :)
 
If you want to contribute code, please follow the existing code style as much as possible. When you feel like
you are changing a lot of things/refactoring, please open an issue first so we can discuss it. I'm always open for improvements, but I want to avoid big changes that go against the original vision of the project.
